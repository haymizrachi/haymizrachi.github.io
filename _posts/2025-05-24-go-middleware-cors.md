## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ADVISORY
### Insecure CORS Configuration in GoFiber Framework

**CVE ID:** <a href="https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-fmg4-x8pw-hjhg">GHSA-fmg4-x8pw-hjhg</a>  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Published:** February 21, 2024  
**Affected Package:** github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

### üìã VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

The GoFiber web framework contains a critical CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware vulnerability that allows dangerous misconfigurations. The middleware permits setting wildcard origins (`*`) while simultaneously enabling credentials sharing, creating a severe security breach that violates CORS security standards.

### üéØ AFFECTED VERSIONS
- **Vulnerable:** All versions < 2.52.1
- **Patched:** Versions >= 2.52.1
- **Components:** 
  - `github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2`
  - `github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2/middleware/cors`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY IMPACT

**Risk Level:** HIGH to CRITICAL

This misconfiguration exposes applications to:
- **Unauthorized data access** from any origin
- **Credential theft** through malicious websites
- **Session hijacking** attacks
- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)** vulnerabilities
- **Data exfiltration** from authenticated users

Any malicious website can now make credentialed requests to your application, bypassing the same-origin policy that protects users.

### üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

The vulnerability exists in `cors.go` where the middleware fails to validate the dangerous combination of:
```go
AllowOrigins: "*"
AllowCredentials: true
```

This configuration violates RFC specifications and security best practices, as browsers should reject such configurations but the middleware doesn't prevent developers from creating them.

### üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**1. UPDATE IMMEDIATELY**
```bash
go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2@latest
```

**2. AUDIT YOUR CORS CONFIGURATION**
Review all CORS middleware implementations for:
- Wildcard origins with credentials enabled
- Overly permissive origin lists
- Missing validation logic

**3. TEMPORARY WORKAROUND** (if immediate update isn't possible)
Manually validate CORS settings in your application:
```go
if cfg.AllowCredentials && cfg.AllowOrigins == "*" {
    panic("INSECURE CORS: Cannot use wildcard origin with credentials")
}
```

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED SECURE CONFIGURATION

```go
// SECURE - Specific origins with credentials
app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
    AllowOrigins: "https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com",
    AllowCredentials: true,
}))

// SECURE - Wildcard without credentials
app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
    AllowOrigins: "*",
    AllowCredentials: false,
}))
```
