Welcome back, It's Hay here with another important topic.
<br /><br />
Today, I want to discuss about a vulnerability that is rarely talked and often stays under the hood, yet represents a significant security issue once it's found - 'Type Juggling' Vulnerability:

</p>

### TL;DR:

Programming languages like `PHP` support 'loose comparison' operators (==, !=) that interpret equality differently in `if` statements. This can lead to security bypass issues, present risks to the entire application.

Make sure to check and compare both the value and their type to ensure the comparison is based on strict (===, !==) comparison.

<br />
### What 'Loose Comparison' is all about?
In languages like PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, comparison operations are based on the values of variables rather than their types, which is known as 'loose' comparison.
<br /><br />
This approach can lead to issues in certain cases, unlike 'strict' comparison where both value and type must be matched.

<br />
### Comparision Table - Overview:
To illustrate the differences between loose and strict comparison types, `PHP.net` [^2] presents various use cases scenarios that highlight the importance of using the correct comparison operator to get the right outcomes:
