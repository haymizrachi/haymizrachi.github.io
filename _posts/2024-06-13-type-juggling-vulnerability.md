Welcome back,
<br />
It's Hay here with another important topic.
<br /><br />
Today, I want to discuss about a vulnerability that is rarely talked and often stays under the hood, yet represents a significant security issue once it's found - 'Type Juggling' Vulnerability:

</p>

For a web application to function correctly, it needs to perform various comparison and calculation checks on the backend. These include authorizing users based on their relevant privileges, managing a password reset mechanism for users who have forgotten their passwords, validating sessions to authenticate users, and more.

All the examples mentioned above require the use of comparison statements to achieve their functionality properly. Attackers who understand this potential may attempt to bypass these mechanisms and leading to unexpected results.

### TL;DR

Programming languages like `PHP` support 'loose comparison' operators (==, !=) that interpret equality differently in `if` statements. This can lead to security bypass issues and present risks to the entire application.

Make sure to check and compare both the value and their type to ensure the comparison is based on strict (===, !==) comparison.

__Note:__ In PHP versions newer than PHP 5, this issue has been resolved.

### What 'Loose Comparison' is all about?
In languages like PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, comparison operations are based on the values of variables rather than their types, which is known as 'loose' comparison.
<br /><br />
This approach can lead to issues in certain cases, unlike 'strict' comparison where both value and type must be matched.

### PHP Comparision Table:
To illustrate the differences between loose and strict comparison types, `PHP.net` [^2] presents various use cases scenarios that highlight the importance of using the correct comparison operator to get the right outcomes:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/loose_compare_table.png" alt="php_loose_comparison_table" />
</p>
<p align="center">Loose comparisons table</p>

Versus:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/strict_compare_table.png" alt="php_strict_comparison_table" />
</p>
<p align="center">Strict comparisons table</p>

Some unexpected examples which yields `True` in loose comparison, whereas it yields `False` in strict comparison:
  * `"php" == 0`
  * `"10 foxes on the tree" == 10`
  * `0e13466324543662017 == 0e5932847`

<br />
### Vunlerable Scenario Demonstation:
Let's take a look at a code snippet responsible for validating the authenticated user's cookie to grant them the appropriate privileges on the web application:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/vulnerable_cookie_validation.png" alt="vulnerable_cookie_validation" />
</p>

From the attacker's perspective, we can see that the function receives the cookie from the user's side, which consists of three parts:
  1. Username cookie
  2. Token cookie
  3. Date Expiration cookie

The parameters controlled by the attacker are the `username`, which the attacker wants to impersonate to take over the account, and the `expiration` cookie, which is also controlled by the attacker. `token` is pulled directly from the application's database and seems to not be under the control of the attacker.

### Conclusion
