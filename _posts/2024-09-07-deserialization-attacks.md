Cheers!
<br />
I took a short break and returned with a new security post :relaxed:
<br /><br />
Let's discuss today on what Deserialization is and give a demonstration example, as it can sometimes can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation and additional weaknesses with severe impacts on the entire application.
<br /><br />
This time, I was digging deep inside the Internet and discovered a cool Deseralization challenge from '<a href="https://ctftime.org/event/119">Plaid CTF 2014</a>' called 'the kPOP challenge' which will help us better understand this vulnerability in this blog post.
<br /><br />
__Note:__ This challenge can be solved using two different approaches to achieve the same outcome. In this post, we chose to present one of them.
<br /><br />
The CTF source code files can be downloaded directly from <a href="https://github.com/pwning/plaidctf2014/tree/master/web/kPOP">plaidctf2014 </a> Github repo.

<br />
Let's get started â€“
<br /><br />
Applications, in general, often rely on handling serialized data to function correctly. It's crucial to examine how this data is deserialized to ensure it's done safely. As attackers or researchers, we focus on instances where data is deserialized without proper validation or where serialized input is directly trusted. These deserialization opportunities, known as `sinks` can occur in a specific functions like `unserialize()` and `serialize()` that depend on user-provided input.
<br /><br />
Once we understand what we're looking for, let's take a closer look at the application's source code:
<br /><br />
The first step is to identify the PHP classes used within the application and examine their relationships and interactions. This can be easily done by using the `CTRL+SHIFT+F` shortcut in Visual Studio Code:
<br />
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/vscode_classes_list.png" alt="vscode_classes_list" />
</p>

In order to better understand the relationships between kPOP classes in a more visual way, we can create a UML diagram based on the above class properties using PlantUML Editor[^1]. This diagram represents the system's structure and design, illustrating the various classes and their relationships, including inheritance, associations, and dependencies:
<br />

</p>
<p align="center">kPOP UML Diagram</p>

<br />
Once we have a basic understanding of the class relations, let's focus on the relevant `sinks` that handle serialization based on user-supplied input.
<br />
Using the same method in VSCode, let's search for all occurrences of the `unserialize` function in the code:
<br /><br />

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/unserialize_function.png" alt="unserialize_function" />
</p>
The search results reveal three different occurrences, spread across two files:
* classes.php
* import.php

We can see that some occurrences of `serialize` depend on SQL return results (e.g., $row[0]), which are not influenced by user input. However, the other instances appear to be more promising for us.
<br /><br />
We will focus on the `import.php` file:
<br />
<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/unserialize_import_php.png" alt="unserialize_import_php" />
</p>
Class objects are immediately get deserialized once an `unserialize` call is triggered. We can exploit line 5 in the image above to inject our malicious class object, which will be demonstrated later in this article.
<br /><br />
At this stage, we have an injection entry point that depends on the provided `$_POST['data']` parameter and get serialized. Let's now take a closer look at the class declarations themselves.

When examining the code, the function that immediately caught my eye on is `file_put_contents`. To better understand its usage, I referred to the `PHP.net` documentation page:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/file_put_contents_php.png" alt="file_put_contents_php" />
</p>
<p align="center">PHP.net Manual</p>

This function can be our <ins>first primitive</ins> for finding a way to write a malicious file on the web server's filesystem, which could serve as a web shell backdoor for executing shell commands!
<br /><br />
So, if we can control the filename written to disk (e.g., `cmd.php`) and its contents, we can write PHP code such as `system()` function to execute any command we want.

<br /><br />
The final serialized payload will be as follows, in Base64 format:

`Tzo2OiJMeXJpY3MiOjI6e3M6OToiACoAbHlyaWNzIjtzOjEyOiJzaGVsbF9seXJpY3MiO3M6`
<br />

We can use the Online PHP Unserializer[^2] to visualize the decoded payload in a Class Object format:

### Conclusion

Deserialization vulnerabilities have quite high entry barrier and require strong programming and research skills, making them as one of the most difficult vulnerabilities to identify in web applications. However, they have the most impactful severities once discovered.

I challenge you to keep looking after these vulnerabilities and not give up!
